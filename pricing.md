# BrainTool Pricing and Data Philosophy
There's been a trend for the last while to give software away for free and make money off of the data you can collect and sell. BrainTool strives to take a completely hands off approach to your data. Your data is yours, BrainTool uses it with your permission to provide you tools to manage, organize and access it. With a subscription or purchase you are paying for those tools and their continued improvement, and keeping your data to yourself.

The fully-functional free version and current low pricing are designed to encourage broad adoption. See the [vision and overview](overview) page for more details.

<i><small>NB the previous 0.9.9 Store version of the extension had different, higher, subscription costs but had no enforcement or non-free features. Based on input received the pricing has been reduced and a one-time purchase option added</small></i>
