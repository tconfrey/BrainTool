# BrainTool Search and Keyboard Controls
The latest version of BrainTool added the ability to search across all your topics, pages and notes. <!--more--> As with all BrainTool functions it is fully keyboard enabled. Using search to navigate across your notes, find what you are looking for and then open or close tabs and tab groups, all without lifting your fingers from the keyboard, makes for a transformed browser experience!

See what I mean by listening through the brief (< 1min) demo video below.
