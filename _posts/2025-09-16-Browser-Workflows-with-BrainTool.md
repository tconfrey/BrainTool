# Browser Workflows with BrainTool
This post describes ways BrainTool can improve your browser workflows. It's illustrated with a set of short videos and video shorts.

BrainTool is a browser extension that allows you to save, annotate, categorize and re-find web pages; as well as open, close and organize browser windows and tabs. And since an open tab is basically a task, BrainTool is also a basic task manager! This 40 second video gives the motivation and an animated overview:

The BrainTool 'Topic Manager' holds your topic organization and saved pages per topic. From there you can find pages and open and close their tabs. The 'Bookmarker' is a browser toolbar tool that lets you save pages under a given topic, with optional notes. This 44 second screen recording shows an overview: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lhHBbBRyEU&list=PLhaw8BE1kin3QoDaTxVXhO406kswXYlLF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BT in Brief</a>

BrainTool's hierarchical topics are a great organizational tool. This 38 second video illustrates drag and drop topic organization, as well as dragging external links into the topic tree: [BT Drag and Drop.](https://youtu.be/vdf5vR9ejzw){:target="_blank" rel="noopener "}

BrainTool also has powerful searching and filtering functions to help you find what you're looking for. Another video short shows how that works: [Search, Filter, Find.](https://youtube.com/shorts/C0lncIPZRfU?si=bJcGMO_yczV5vbOs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener "}

Topics and tabs can be tracked as tasks in BrainTool's basic task manager. Here's a one minute demo of it in action, as well as a brief flash of its ability to use plain text org-mode files to integrate into a larger productivity and PKM system: [BrainTool TODO Manager.](https://youtube.com/shorts/eQwf_43akr8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener "}

As well as those basic workflows there are any number of other ways BrainTool's capabilities can improve your browser productivity. Here's a few, demonstrated in short videos. No doubt there are many more.

  - BrainTool's bookmarks bar integration provides a handy way to pre-load every browser window with a set of links organized and ready to go during a meeting, class, presentation or offsite: [Bookmarks Bar Workflow.](https://youtube.com/shorts/5vtiHYbduxU){:target="_blank" rel="noopener "}

  - It's common to have a set of dashboards or project pages or some other set of websites that you need to review or update on a periodic basis. This is the 'Checklist Workflow'. Here's how BrainTool can help make sure you get to those tasks on time and make it more efficient to check them off: [Checklist Workflow.](https://youtube.com/shorts/PFUvFTSIruM){:target="_blank" rel="noopener "}

  - Finally for this post, the 'Shopping Workflow' shows how you can keep your options organized when you're shopping online: [Shopping Workflow](https://youtu.be/L4CmBWqg3pU){:target="_blank" rel="noopener "}
